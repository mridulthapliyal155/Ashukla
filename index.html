                <h2>Celebrating the Entrepreneurial Spirit- how an individual’s efforts transformed humanity </h2>

                <p> Do you notice things around us- and the technology behind them. The Smartphone that we cannot live without; airplanes that enable us to travel around the globe in a few days; medicines that cure us; produce more food; make sky-scrappers safe. They all are possible through inventions- made by scientists and inventors, who dedicate their lives to humanity, thereby gratifying us by making our lives more pleasant. Their life is disciplined and selfless, they forego the pleasures of life and dedicate their fruit of hard work to the society that inspires generations. However, what is sad is that the original inventor often dies in unworthy conditions, since their work is often ahead of time and after decades someone makes millions.  </p>

                <p>So I try to bring the invention, inventor and the story behind those inventions- how invention was born and how it matured and finally replaced by a better invention. 
                </p>

                <p> <b> I am Amit Shukla, I have more than 15 years of experience as Consultant, I have helped several incubated startups at IIT Kanpur, IIIT Delhi, IIITDM Jabalpur, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad and other institutes. <br>
                My professional interest are Helping companies utilize the physical and intellectual resources at prestigious IITs (presently cover IIT Delhi & Kanpur)

                <h3> <q>I love inventions and more so about the stories and the inventors behind that invention. Inventions are embodiment of creativity and perseverance.</q></h3>

                </div>

                <p>Whenever we hear the word ‘Patent’ we think of something superior, something great it bears a positive influence. We bring this magical word ‘Patent’ more close to you, even if you are not an inventor. </p>

                <p>We identify important pioneering patents filed by famous inventors like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Tesla, Marconi, Morse, Graham Bell, Carl Benz, Davenport, Rudolf Diesel, Noyce, Louis Pasteur, Jagadish Chunder Bose and many others, who have inspired several generations.    
                </p>

                <p>Their hard-work, perseverance and intelligence are recorded in the patents filed by them. These inventions are from all walks of life, like telephone, car, electricity, airplanes, medicine, sports, etc. which even a common man has used and thus is able to relate to it. These patents contain beautiful hand drawn drawings that have an artistic value too and this appeals to even a common person.  The elegantly framed fine art in these historical patent drawings, along-with story relating these inventions will fill your board room with inspiring thoughts and enrich your workplace.
